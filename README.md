The Boxalino plugin for Magento pre-integrates the most important key technical components of Boxalino (so you don't have to):

1. Data export (including products, customers and transaction exports for multi-shops with test and live accounts and supporting regular delta synchronizations)
2. Boxalino tracker (pre-integration of Boxalino JavaScript tracker, our own tracker which follows strictly the Google Analytics model).
3. Search, Autocomplete and layered navigation (faceted navigation) with all intelligence functionalities pre-integrated (auto-correction, sub-phrases relaxation, etc.)
4. Similar and Complementary recommendations on product page and cross-selling on basket (cart) page
5. Layered navigation, to let Boxalino optimize the entire product navigation on your web-site

In addition, it is very easy to extend this pre-installed set-up to benefit from the following additional features:

1. Recommendations everywhere (easy to extend recommendations widgets on the home page, category pages, landing pages, content pages, etc.).
2. Quick-finder to enable new ways to find product with simple search criteria and compine it with soft-facets with our unique smart-scoring capacities (see an example here with the gift-finder of www.geschenkidee.ch).
3. Personalized newsletter & trigger personalized mail (use the base of data export and tracking from our plugin to simply integrate personalized product recommendations in your e-mail marketing activities and push notifications on your mobile app)
4. Advanced reporting to integrate any learnings and analysis of your online behaviors in other Business Intelligence and Data Mining projects with our flexible Reporting API functionalities
